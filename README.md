# React Initial Templates for Starting a Project

This is a custom collection I've put together to kickstart React projects based on their use cases. It's a standard I've been following in my projects, and it has been serving me well.

As part of the initial setup, all projects start with Vite and React Router Dom.

I believe this can be helpful not only to me but also to many others.
